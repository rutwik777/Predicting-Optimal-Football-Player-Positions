# Predicting-Optimal-Football-Player-Positions

## Objective: Predicted football player positions based on individual characteristics using data visualization and machine learning models.

### Data Visualization:
Analyzed age distribution, its impact on ball control, and visualized how height affects parameters like stamina, pace, and heading accuracy.
Explored relationships between wages, overall ratings, player position, and nationality.
Identified top 50 players and their clubs, and visualized the fastest players.


### Data Handling: Managed missing values, encoded categorical data, performed feature scaling, and applied RandomOverSampling for dataset balance.

### Modeling: Trained models using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and various AdaBoost techniques, achieving 98% accuracy.
